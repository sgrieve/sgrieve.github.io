title: C++ Maps
---

Maps can be used in C++ to store data in key, value pairs which can then be indexed by the
key. Initialize a map as follows:

{% highlight c %}
map<int,bool> myMap;
{% endhighlight %}

Here we have initialized a map to contain pairs of data where the key is an `int`
and the value is a `bool`. The container is defined with no size, similar to a vector
and we can add data as follows:

{% highlight c %}

int firstkey = 5;
int secondkey = 1;

myMap[firstkey] = true;
myMap[secondkey] = false;

{% endhighlight %}

Any datatype can be used for either the key or the value, and the order of the data
does not matter, so here we have added the key value 5 before the key value 1.

## iterating over maps

## retrieving values

## sorted maps

This is a very brief overview of how to get started with maps, for more detail check the
[docs]().

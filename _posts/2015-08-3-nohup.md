title: Redirecting Nohup Output to File
---

If I want to run a command using `nohup` and redirect the output to a file other than
the default `nohup.out` I can use the following syntax to redirect stdout and stderr into the
same file:

{% hightlight sh%}

nohup [Command here] > filename.out 2>&1 &

{% endhighlight %}

The first `>` redirects stdout to `filename.out`, `2>` corresponds to the stderr which is redirected
into the same place as stdout `&1` and the final `&` returns you to the terminal immediately, ready for the next
command.

title: Copying files via ssh
---

To move files between machines which you can connect to via ssh, you can use the command `scp`. To copy a file from a remote machine to your local machine use:

{% highlight sh %}
$ scp <username>@<address of remote machine>:<path to file to be copied on remote machine> <destination path on local machine>
{% endhighlight %}

and to copy a file from your local machine to the remote machine use the reverse:

{% highlight sh %}
$ scp <path to file on local machine> <username>@<address of remote machine>:<path to destination on remote machine>
{% endhighlight %}

So as an example if I had an account called `SWDG` which I used to log into a machine accessed via `ssh server.comany.com` I could copy a file as follows to get it onto my local machine:

{% highlight sh %}
$ scp SWDG@server.company.com:/home/SWDG/data.zip home/personal_computer/myfiles/
{% endhighlight %}

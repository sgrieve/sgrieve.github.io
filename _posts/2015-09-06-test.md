This is a test post that I am writing from a blank page.

Here is a _header_
------------------


I *want* to add a link here to this cool thing on stack overflow <a href="www.google.com">here</a>


{% highlight py %}
#this is some python

x = range(0,50)

for i in x:
  print i

import numpy as np

a = np.linspace(0,1,0.01)

print a
 
{% endhighlight linenos %}

here is a **quote**:

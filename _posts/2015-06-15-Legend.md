title: Placing the Legend in Matplotlib
---

Here is a quick remider of how to place a legend in a matplotlib plot.

The `pyplot.legend()` method takes the argument `loc` which corresponds to a 
position on the plot. `0` chooses the best location based on where
the data is plotted. The example plot below shows where a legend will be placed
for each value of `loc`:


![Locations of a legend]({{ site.url }}/images/legend.png)

Interestingly, values 5 and 7 both correspond to the same location.


You can also pass `loc` a tuple of x,y coordinates in axis units, if you need precise
placement, check out the [docs](http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.legend) for more info.

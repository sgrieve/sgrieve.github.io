title: Creating numbered directories
---

For a paper I was submitting I wanted to create a directory to store each figure I created, so wanted to create a series of directories named `Fig_1` through to `Fig_8`. Which can be done like this:

{% highlight sh %}
$ mkdir {1..8}
{% endhighlight %}

Which will create directories called 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 and 8. But if we want to add an identifier we can use:

{% highlight sh %}
$ mkdir Fig_{1..8}
{% endhighlight %}

Which produces the required directories for my figures. This method also works with sequences of letters, so if we wanted to create a directory for each letter of the alphabet:

{% highlight sh %}
$ mkdir {A..Z}
{% endhighlight %}

This technique is called brace expansion, and is implemented in most flavors of bash. More information can be found at [this stack overflow question](http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/640/147030) and these [man pages](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#Brace-Expansion).

I'm a geomorphologist who writes a lot of code. I'm interested in hillslopes and
sediment transport and you can learn more about me [here](http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/homes/s0675405/), check out my publications [here](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=VwQbAzQAAAAJ&hl=en) and can check my github page [here](https://github.com/sgrieve). 

I often find myself searching docs and stackoverflow for things that I swear I have read before,
but can no longer find, so this site will now act as my short term memory. 

I used to run a [GIS blog](http://pygis.blogspot.com) which is no longer updated, 
but some of the posts there are still relevant.

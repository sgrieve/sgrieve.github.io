LSDTopoTools
---

I am one of the developers of the [LSDTopoTools project](http://lsdtopotools.github.io), an open source topographic analysis package written in C++ to facilitate robust, reproducible analysis of topographic data for the surface science community.

spatial-efd

I have also produced a Python package, [spatial-efd](http://spatial-efd.readthedocs.io) which performs Fourier analysis of shapefile data to allow quantitative analysis of planform morphologies. This code has been published in the [Journal of Open Source Software](http://dx.doi.org/10.21105/joss.00189)

ScholarDOI
---

I have released a Google Chrome extension which gives quick access to a proper bibtex file with a DOI for Google Scholar entries. You can get the extension [here](https://github.com/sgrieve/ScholarDOI), at present it has not been released on the Chrome Store as it is still a work in progress.

I also spend a lot of my time working on other software projects, both for my research and for fun, check out my [github](http://github.com/sgrieve) to see what I'm tinkering with at the moment.
